# Customizing your Virtual Machine

Codespaces uses a Virtual Machine in the cloud to run VS Code. You can customize how that machine behaves controlling, for example, which extensions are loaded, customizing the command prompt, installing software, running a script when the machine finishes loading or controlling machine level settings.

You do this through the use of a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file. This file lets you control how your environment works. 

## Exercise

1. Make sure you're in the [supercharge-customize](https://github.com/octocloudlabs/supercharge-customize) repository and that your codespace is open.
1. Locate the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

---

## What We Change

Our setup is pretty simple, we want to control three things:

- Which extensions are installed in a workspace through the `"extensions": []` array
- Manually modify the command prompt to make it shorter during the recording with `"onCreateCommand"`
- Optionally launch the npm start command when the codespace is created with `"postStartCommand"`

## Different Ways to Find and Load Extensions

One of the best places to look for extensions is the VS Code Marketplace.

### Exercise
1. Go to the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode)
1. Type in tabout in the search
1. Click on the first result
1. Scroll down and look for the Unique Identifier under More Info
1. Copy the unique identifier
1. Paste into the extensions array

Whenever you modify the `devcontainer.json` file, Codespaces will ask if you want to rebuild the container. If you're not done making changes, you can ignore or close the notification. It might take a minute or so to rebuild the container.

The **tabout** extension lets you move the cursor out of quotes using the tab key. After the container is rebuilt, place your cursor inside one of the double quotes in the `devcontainer.json` file and hit tab.

Simple, but pretty handy.

## Using the Extensions Panel

You can also use the extensions panel to get the unique identifier.

### Exercise

1. Open the extensions panel
1. Search for Dracula
1. Click on the Dracula Official theme
1. Click on Install
1. Click on the "Set Color Theme" button
1. Scroll down and look for the unique identifier and copy it
1. Switch back to the `devcontainer.json` file
1. Paste the unique identifier into the extensions array

In order for a theme to be automatically loaded with your project, the extension must be installed, the theme must be set, and the unique identifier must be in the extensions array.

## Rebuilding the Container

**Note:** Remember that you have to rebuild a container in order to see the changes. If you have closed out of the rebuild popup, but still want to rebuild the container:

1. Click on the codespaces button at the bottom left of the screen
1. Choose Rebuild Container

## Devcontainer Walkthrough 

You can also have Codespaces suggest a `devcontainer.json` file for you with some prebuilt settings. The community has created a lot of these files for you to use.

Alpine, for example, is a very small Linux distribution. It's very fast and lightweight. It's also very popular in the Docker community.

### Exercise

1. Click on the codespaces button at the bottom left of the screen
1. Choose "Add DevContainer Configuration Files..."
1. Choose Alpine
1. Choose a Version
1. Add options
1. Allow overwrite

You can take a peek at what was installed and undo the changes if you don't like them.

## More Info

Here's the [full documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference) for what you can modify.

## Practice
In the next session, you're going to be working with an extension called CodeTour. Try installing the extension by yourself before continuing.

Make sure you've added the Code Tour extension before moving on to [Creating Self Guided Tours](../ray/lab-6.html)
