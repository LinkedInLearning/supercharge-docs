## Controlling the Presentation

It's real important that you provide a good experience for the learner and one of the keys to that is making sure things are visible. Visual Studio Code has no way of controlling the size of the text in the primary bar.

LinkedIn has standardized on about 140% with your browser zoom controls.

Although that seems like a very large size for everything, it displays well on laptops and smaller screens for watching videos.

## Resolution

We generally record in HD (1920x1080) and try to use monitors with 2x density, so we can get a max 4k resolution in the recording to improve clarity and allow for zooming in if necessary.

The font size and other settings in the `.vscode/settings.json` file are adjusted for these proportions.
