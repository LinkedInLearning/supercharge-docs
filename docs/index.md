## Welcome
Get ready for the hands-on labs in the **Supercharge your onboarding and developer training with GitHub Codespaces** workshop. 

*Our contention is that GitHub Codespaces are an invaluable tool for educators and trainers. Using GitHub Codespaces means you'll spend less time on local set-up which gives your employees and students more time learning and practicing. Plus. it is an isolated in-browser development environment that allows for risk-free learning on any machine in seconds. And your labs or onboarding documents can be accessed from the GitHub repository.*

You may have experience with GitHub repositories, GitHub Codespaces, or VS Code. In today's workshop we want you to change your perspective on how it can be used as a training or onboarding tool.
**Our goal** is to show you how GitHub Codespaces belongs in the educators toolbox. 

This workshop is divided into **three** sections:

1. Creating and managing GitHub Codespaces
2. Explore how LinkedIn Learning uses GitHub Codespaces in video training
3. Customize GitHub Codespaces for your team

### Creating and managing GitHub Codespaces

In this section you'll create a codespace using an animation open-source repository as the basis for our studies.

You'll learn how to:

* Fork the open source project to your account
* Create a codespace
* Restart an existing codespace
* Manage existing GitHub Codespaces
* See the Visual Studio Code enhancements (extensions and UI)
* See the Command Line Interface customizations
* Run an interactive live web server from the command line
* Modify and view an animation example from the project

###	Explore how LinkedIn Learning uses GitHub Codespaces in video training

LinkedIn Learning knows a lot about creating video training content. We have over 18,000 courses, including an extensive tech library. In the last year, we've been busy exploring GitHub Codespaces and formalizing how to integrate them into our tech courses. In this section you'll explore our **Hands-On Introduction to Java** course. You'll get to see how the instructor seamlessly works with the exercise examples in the course repository. Then we'll talk about the lessons we've learned.

### Customize GitHub Codespaces for your team

Using a codespace is simple, at least from the learners' perspective. However, creating this idyllic and seamless experience requires preparation.

You'll learn how to:

* Choose a pre-defined Docker template
* Configure the Docker container
* Add Extensions to Visual Studio Code
* Customize the command prompt
* Create a Code Tour
