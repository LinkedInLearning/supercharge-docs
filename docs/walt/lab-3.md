## Explore VS Code

You are looking at the **Visual Studio Code** application running in the cloud, accessible via your browser. It's also possible to create a codespace and use the VS Code desktop application (on your PC or Mac) to connect to the codespace. The default option is to use the browser.



### Familiar to VS Code users

The browser version of VS Code is similar to the desktop version which is a plus for your employees or students that know VS Code. The main differences between the two is the menu location. Check out the hamburger menu in the upper left of the application.

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

>With Codespaces, you can work on most keyboard-enabled devices with a modern browser, as long as it has a modern browser.  We've tested it on iPad Pro, Android tablets, a Raspberry Pi, a 2012 Laptop running Ubuntu off a USB Stick and a $3000 MacBook Pro. Once it's booted up, the experience is virtually the same, so yes you can work on your projects from anywhere.

### The Activity Bar

The Activity Bar is docked along the left side of the editor.  Here you'll find buttons for showing various windows (Explorer, Search, Source Control, Debug, Extensions, Settings, etc.). In this lab section, we'll look at the Explorer, Source Control, and Extensions tools.

The blue circles with numbers are notifications from the associated tool.  For example the number 3 in the screenshot indicates there are three files that haven't been committed to source control yet.
