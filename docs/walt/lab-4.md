### Explore the VS Code extensions

VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. Each codespace starts with a set of predefined extensions. These are defined by the codespace owner in a configuration file. 

You'll see how to customize this list of extensions later in the workshop!

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**
> This is a nice advantage for students, as the instructor can ensure all the tools they need to get started are available.
