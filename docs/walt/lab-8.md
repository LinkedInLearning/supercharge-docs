### Manage Codespaces

If you leave your codespace running without interaction, or if you exit your codespace without explicitly stopping it, the codespace will timeout after a period of inactivity and stop running. 

Or, you can stop a codespace at any time.

### Stop the Codespace within Visual Studio Code

* Click the **Codespaces** button in the lower left corner of the editor.

 The Command Palette appears in the upper center of the editor. Choose the **Stop Current Codespace** option.

You'll see this screen below after the codespace stops. You can restart it by clicking the **Restart Codespace** button, but we'll look at another way to start it.

### Start the codespace from GitHub site
From the Codespaces URL (/gitub.dev). Let's navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/octocloudlabs/supercharge-canvas-fun" target="_blank">repository page</a>.


* Click the green Code button. This time, you'll see the screen below. Note the information supplied:
  * The codespace name
  * What branch is associated with the codespace
  * Whether there are any repository differences between the GitHub version and the codespace version

To restart the codespace, you can click on the codespace name, but let's look at how to manage the codespace before going any further.

### Manage your Codespaces

* Click the **...** button, then choose the **Manage Codespaces** menu item.

On the page, you can see additional information about the codespace. For example, you can see the environment configuration (2-core, 4GB RAM, 32GB).

### Option to delete the codespace

There are costs associated with storing codespaces. Therefore, it is wise to delete any codespaces you no longer need. You'll find the Delete option in the **...** menu. While you could delete it now, we recommend keeping it during the workshop.

### Finished

That's it, you are done with the first lab section!
