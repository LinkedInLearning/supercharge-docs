## View and edit a webpage

This project is a **fork of CanvasFun**, an open-source project.  you'll view some of the animation examples in the browser. To do this, we need to run the Live Server extension.

One advantage of Live Server is it auto-refreshes the web page whenever you edit the file and save the changes.

With just a couple of clicks, Live Server lets you see your page live in another browser tab. Better yet, it features live reloading, so when you update your code, the changes are also reflected in the browser.

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

>Live Server lets the learners experiment with web code and instantly see the results in the browser. This works in any browser.

## Open some files

You created the codespace on the supercharge-canvas-fun `master` branch. In Visual Studio Code you can see all the files from that branch in the Explorer.

1. In the Activity Bar click the Explorer button
<img src='../assets/img/a-lab-10.png' alt="lab image" class="img-lab" >

2. Navigate to the TextParticles folder
3. Open the `index.html` file in the editor.
4. Open the `src/js/index.js` file in the editor.

### Start Live Server and view files

5. Right click the `index.html` file (in the TextParticles folder) and choose `Open with Live Server`.

### View the page

Visual Studio Code starts the Live Server, then opens a new browser tab showing the webpage (the URL will end with `github.dev/TextParticles/index.html`).

1. View the webpage, and move your mouse over the image to see the particles animate!


### Edit the Javascript
1. Switch browser tabs and view the Codespace.
2. In the Explorer, open the `/TextParticles/src/js/index.js` file.
3. This is the code that creates the canvas, loads the image, and starts the animation.
4. You will change the image shown in the animation.
5. Comment out line 12.
   
```js
let url =
    "https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png";
```

* Uncomment line 15.

```js
  // let url =
  // "https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/octocat-accessories.png";

```
* Change the canvas color on line 30.

```js
    c.clear("orange");
```

* Save the file, switch browser tabs, and refresh the page (F5) to see the changes you made.

ðŸ’¡ **Instructor tip:**

> Running a web server on the GitHub Codespaces gives the learners instant access to a full featured web app. It works well for front-end development and server side web applications. Performance of browser-based code is the same as running a real site.
